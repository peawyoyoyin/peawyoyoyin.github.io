    <h1>Piriyapong Laopongsit</h1>
</center>

Hello. My name is Piriyapong Laopongsit. I was born in 1997 at Chiang Rai, Thailand.

I graduated from Department of Computer Engineering, Chulalongkorn University in 2019,
so I know a thing or two about computers.

I write things in Python, JavaScript, Java and Scala. I prefer React when it comes to
frontend applications.

My interests revolve around Programming Languages, Programming, Web Development,
Game Development, and Software Development in general.

My projects (the ones I am proud to present) include:
 - [Gitthereum](https://github.com/gitthereum/gitthereum) - git-based blockchain.
 ([Medium Link (TH)](https://medium.com/@peawyoyoyin/gitthereum-transforming-git-into-a-working-blockchain-538df6617ac6))
 - [MHRCC](https://github.com/blead/mhrcc) - Multi-hop Radio-Controlled Cars.
 - [Mememe](https://github.com/mememe-org/core) - A compiler that compiles YAML into meme images.

I am a proud member of [Thinc.](https://www.thinc.in.th), a student innovation club of Chulalongkorn University.
